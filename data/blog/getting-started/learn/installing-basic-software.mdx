# Installing basic software
In installing basic software, we will help you to install the tools and software you need to get started.

## Which software and tools are commonly used

- A computer. That sounds obvious but there are apps that can help you to code from your mobile. It's best to start with a computer or a laptop. For serious web development, we recommend investing in a laptop running Windows, Linux or macOS with a minimum of 8GB RAM and an i5 processor or higher.
- A text editor, to write code in. There are many code editors available in the market. Any text editor (e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)) can be used to write code but office document editors like MS Word do not fall in this category.
- Web browsers, to test code. There is a wide array of web browsers to choose from (e.g. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge). You can test your code in any of the modern web browsers. We recommend testing your website in multiple browsers to test how your website looks in different browsers.
- A graphics editor, like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html). It is not required but it comes in handy to get the values of margins, paddings and font-size of a design. You can also tweak images to your liking for your personal website using a graphics tool.
- A version control system, to manage files, collaborate on a project with a team, share code and avoid conflicts (and they are hard to avoid). [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most popular version control system out there with hosting services like [Github](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).
- And many more!

## Which software do you need, right now?

That looks like a big list. Fortunately, you can get started in web development without knowing anything about most of these. In this article, we will help you install the bare minimum tools that you need to get started.

### Installing a text editor

You probably have a basic text editor installed in your system. By default, windows come with Notepad and macOS comes with TextEdit.

For web development, we can do better than Notepad or TextEdit. We recommend starting with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is a free editor, that offers live previews and code hints.

### Installing modern web browsers

Multiple browser options are available to test your code. We will install a couple of desktop browsers from the following list to test your code:

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/)
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) (macOS Only)

We recommend using Chrome as it has [more than 69% of the market share](https://netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22browser%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22browsersDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222019-11%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222020-10%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D) followed by Microsoft Edge and Firefox.

Before going on, make sure you have installed the Visual Studio Code text editor and two browsers.
