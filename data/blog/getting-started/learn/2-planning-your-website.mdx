# Planning your website
There is a famous proverb: If you fail to plan, you plan to fail. First things first, let's plan how your first page is going to look.

## What will we be building
A website can do anything, but we will keep things simple in the beginning. For this exercise we are going to build a bird website that you like.

We'll keep things simple and create a webpage that includes:
- A heading
- An image
- A few paragraphs

## Let's create a sketch
Yes, you read it right. We are going to create a plain sketch of how your first website is going to look like. So take a pen and paper and sketch out how your website is going to look like.

The designers in big companies usually start out by sketching the website on paper and later on build digital mockups using graphic tools. There is also a term for it called wire-framing.

## Let's get some content
The next step in the process is to gather content for your webpage. We decided initially that we are going to build a webpage that includes a heading, an image and a few paragraphs about the bird that you like.

### Text
The title of the website will be the name of the bird.
For paragraph text, you will write a few lines that highlight key information about the bird's characteristics.

### Theme
Every website has a theme. A theme is a set of colors that are used on your website. To choose a color, go to [the Color Picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp).

When you select a color, you will see a code like `#606066`. It is called hex code (hexadecimal code) and represents your color.

Try to select a color that matches the color of your bird.

### Images
You can find the image of your bird on a number of websites. The easiest way is to go to [Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp?gws_rd=ssl) and search with your bird name.

Download the image and save it in your machine.

### Font
Last but not the least, you have to choose a font for your webpage. Google Fonts have loads of free fonts available to use for your web projects. To choose a font:

1. Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and choose a font you like.
2. Save the lines of code provided by Google in your text editor for later use.
