# Organizing files
A website consists of many files from HTML files containing content, CSS files containing styles, JS files containing code and other media assets. You need a sensible file structure to organize these files on your computer.

## Where should your website live on your computer?
When you are working on a website locally, the best practice is to keep all the files in a single folder. The folder should also be accessible. This folder can live anywhere you like but we recommend to keep it on Desktop or your Root to be easily findable.

1. Choose a place to store your website projects. Create a new folder `topcamp-projects` (or similar). This is where all your web projects will live.
2. Inside this folder, create a new folder `my-bird-website` (or similar) for your bird webpage.

> Note on spacing and casing: We recommend naming files and folders in lowercase with no spaces. For spaces, you can use hyphens (-) between the words. This is to avoid problems with case-sensitivity of web servers. Also browsers and web servers treat spaces differently. Some replace space with %20 and some consider a space as the end of the file name.

## What structure should your website have?
Let's build the structure of your bird website. The most common things that a website has are HTML files and separate folders that contains images, CSS files and Javascript files. Let's create those:

1. Open the folder `my-bird-website` that you just created in the VSCode text editor. Create an `index.html` file. This file will contain the content and the images that people see when they land on your website.
2. Create an `assets` folder. This folder will contain all the assets like images, icons or fonts for your website.
3. Create a folder named `styles`. This folder will contain all the CSS files.
4. Create a folder named `scripts`. This directory will contain the Javascript code files being used in your website.


Your folder structure will be looking like this:
