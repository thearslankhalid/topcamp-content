What is internet?

# Introduction

### What is internet?

The internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standard of protocols.

It is a large web of devices connected with each other for communication.

The internet is the world's most popular computer network and its public.

Now there is intranet which is university's or company's own connection of computers communicating with each other.

It began as an academic research project in 1969,

Consider it as a system of post office. But here instead of letters or packages bits are transferred and its a lot faster compare to post.

### Where is internet

Internet has 3 Major parts

### Who runs the internet?

No one runs the internet. It is decentralized network of networks. Everyone can use and access the internet. But there are standards that should be managed.

They are managed by an organization called IETF (Internet engineering task force).

And

There is another corporation called ICANN ( Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). They are responsible for distributing domain names and IP addresses.

And none of the organization has the control on who can connect to the internet or what kind of information could be sent or could not be sent.

## What is IP Address

IP stands for Internet Protocol address.

This is the number that computers use to identify each other on the internet. For example my IP address is?

These are unique to each computer or device.

IPv4 -> 4 billion addresses

IPv6 -> 340 undecellion

## How information is transferred?

Information is transferred in the form of packets.

A packet has two parts.
The header contains information that helps the packet get to its destination, including the length of the packet, its source and destination, and a checksum value that helps the recipient detect if a packet was damaged in transit. After the header comes the actual data.
A packet can contain up to 64 kilobytes of data, which is roughly 20 pages of plain text.

We need to send more information which is determined by Bandwidth. Bandwidth is maximum transmission capactiy of a device.

Bit rate is number of bits that we can send over a given period of time.

Latency -> time it takes for a bit to travel from one place to another.

There are 3 ways of transmission wire, light and radiowaves

## What is DNS?

Domain Name system is a phonebook of the internet.

DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load internet resources
