# CSS basics

CSS is not a programming language. CSS is a style sheet language. It is used to style the content on the web. It controls how the content will be displayed to the user.

Remember creating a `styles` folder in [organizing files](/blog/getting-started/learn/organizing-files), it will contain all the CSS files.

Create a new file named `index.css` in `styles` folder and add the following code:

```css
p {
  color: purple;
}
```

Next we have to link the CSS file:

1. Open the `index.html` file. Copy the following code between the `<head>` and `</head>` tags of the `index.html` file:

```html
<link href="/styles/index.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

2. Save the `index.html` file. Reload the browser. You should see something like this:

![Bird web page with purple text](/static/images/css-basics-1.png)

If your paragraph text is of the color you added in `index.css` file, congratulations it's working.

## Anatomy of a CSS ruleset
Let's study the CSS of the colored paragraph to understand how it works:

![CSS ruleset](/static/images/css-basics-2.png)

A CSS ruleset has the following parts:

1. **Selector**: A selector can be an HTML element (in this case `p`), class name (`.paragraph`) or an id (`#paragraph`). It selects the HTML element.
2. **Declaration**: A declaration is a single rule like `color: red`. It specifies which of the element's property to style. In this case, it's `color`.
3. **Property**: An HTML element has different properties that can be styled. In this case, you styled `color`.
4. **Property value**: It is the value that is assigned to the property of the HTML element. In this case, we styled the `color` property of the `p` element with the value of `red`.

There are some other important points to note in the syntax:

- A ruleset starts with `{` after the selector and ends with `}`
- There is a colon `:` in declaration
- You can declare multiple rules separated by a semicolon `;`. For example

```css
p {
  color: purple;
  font-size: 20px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

## Styling the web page

We have gone over the absolute basics of the CSS. We can now start with styling the content of the web page.

First remove the already added CSS for `p` element making sure that your CSS file is empty.

### Adding the font

In [planning your website](/blog/getting-started/planning-your-website), you selected a font family for your website from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Go to the [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website. Select the font family. Select the font weights of the font and add the link provided by Google fonts in your `index.css` file. The font link will look like:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@400;700&display=swap');

```

This will load the selected Google font in to your website. The next step is to use the font in your website. You can set the font by using `font-family` property. The following CSS will set the font-family of all the elements in HTML document to `Montserrat`: 

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Montserrat';
}
```

If everything goes right, font-family of all the HTML elements in your website will be updated.

### Add some color

Let's add some color to your website. In `planning your website`, we discussed that every website has a theme and used [a color Picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) to select a color. The next steps are:

1. Choose a light color (like <span style={{ color: 'lightgray' }}>lightgray</span>) and a dark background color (like <span style={{ color: 'grey' }}>grey</span>)  for your website theme.
2. Choose a color for the HTML text elements that has a good contrast with the darker background color. For example, <span style={{ color: 'white' }}>white</span> color has good contrast with <span style={{ color: 'grey' }}>grey</span> color.
3. Apply the background color to `html` root element using `background-color` property:

```css
html {
  background-color: lightgray;
}
```

4. Apply the background color to `body` element using `background-color` property:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Montserrat';
  background-color: grey;
}
```

5. Set the color of the text of the HTML elements by setting the value of the `color` property on the `body` element:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Montserrat';
  background-color: grey;
  color: white;
}
```

6. Change the color of the anchor (`a`) element to a different color than white like <span style={{ color: 'palegreen' }}>palegreen</span>.

```css
a {
  color: palegreen;
}
```

7. Set the color of the `a` element to a different color (like <span style={{ color: 'lightblue' }}>lightblue</span>) when it is hovered:

``` css
a:hover {
  color: lightblue;
}
```

> Interactive HTML elements (like anchor tags (a), buttons, etc.) have different states for interactivity. These states can be designed using CSS to create a better user experience for the user. For example, when you hover over a link on a website, it's color or display changes.

### Add some spacing

Your website is looking much better than we started by adding some color. You can improve the presentation of your website further by adding styles for spacing.

Take the following CSS:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Montserrat';
  background-color: grey;
  color: white;

  max-width: 600px;
  margin: 40px auto;
  padding: 40px; 
}
```

1. The text is stretching to the whole website. We limited the text by setting the `max-width` property on the `body`.
2. Next we used `margin` property to add a margin of `40px` from top and bottom and center align the `body` element from left and right.
3. Next we used the `padding` property to give a spacing of `40px` internally to all the HTML elements inside the `body`.

> Margin property is used to give external spacing between elements and padding property is used to give internal spacing between elements.

If the image that you used for your website is larger than `600px` in width, it will overflow the `body` element. In order to avoid this, set the `width` property of the `img` element to 100%:

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
}
```

This makes sure that `img` element always takes the same width as of it's container.

> The readability of the text is very important. You should always make sure that there is a good contrast between text and the background and the text can be read easily by the viewer.

The text is looking a bit squished. You can improve the readability of the text by setting the `line-height` property:

```css
p, li {
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

> Line height is the spacing between two lines of text. It is relative to the font-size of the element. A value of 1.5 means that it will take the current font-size of the element and multiply it with 1.5

You will also have noticed that we are using `p` and `li` selectors separated by a `,`. You can select multiple HTML elements by separating the selectors with a `,` in CSS. The above rule selects all `p` and `li` elements in the HTML document and applies the `line-height`.

## How does it look?

If you have been following along, your website will be looking somewhat closer to this:
