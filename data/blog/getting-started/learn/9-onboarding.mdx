# Onboarding

In this topic, we will cover the high level view of what you can expect from the bootcamp and what we expect from you. We will be helping you to onboard and get started with the bootcamp.

## Introduction

The first activity is to break the ice and introduce yourself. We will start with ourselves and then you can follow.

## Our mission

We do not want to make you a coder. We want to make you a professional who can code, communicate and contribute in a team.

Our mission is to train the next generation of problem solvers, not just coders.

## Pillars of content

We have structured the bootcamp to focus on 3 key areas:

- Code (A hard skill)
- Communication ( A soft skill)
- Contribution ( How to market your self )

## Why Front-end?

There are several reasons as to why front-end is the best route to get into the tech industry:

- It is easier to learn
- Barrier to entry is low
- It has grown very big recently

According to PASHA, MERN Stack is the top most demanding stack in terms of jobs in Pakistan.

## Installing softwares

You will be using:

- VSCode (Visual Studio Code) for coding
- A browser (Google Chrome recommended)
- Discord (for internal communication)
- LinkedIn (for personal branding)
- Notion (for notes or assignments)

Activities:

- Introduce yourself on Discord
- Set up your LinkedIn profile

## What is expected of you

We expect very simple and basic things from all you.

- Be punctual
- Be consistent
- Be polite
- Be responsive
- Ask a ton of questions
- Share your knowledge
- Complete your projects and assignments on time

If you take care of the things mentioned above, we are more than confident that you will come out of this program as a great developer.

## What are we doing?

We are working to make it the best learning experience for you. We want to make it more valuable for you than a 4 year's degree. Here are some of the things that we have planned for you:

- A social event after 2nd checkpoint
- Developer evenings to help you build connections
- Sessions from experienced working professionals
- Resume and CV workshop
- Outreach to multiple company's HR representatives
- Guidance and mentoring sessions to help you go freelance
- Give you a first hand product experience
