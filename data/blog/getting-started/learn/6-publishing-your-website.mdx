# Publishing your website
Now that you have created your very first website, the next step is to make it public, make it available on the internet. There are many options to make your website live.

## What are the options
Making a website live is a complete topic on its own. There are multiple options available to make your website live with the main difference of how much control you can have:

- The most common way is to buy a `domain` and `web hosting` service for your website. A domain is a unique address where users can find your website like: `https://topcamp-website.vercel.app`. Web hosting is rented file space on the hosting provider's web server. It stores your website files and serves the web content to the visitors.
- [Github](https://www.github.com) provides a free service called [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to make your website live for free. Github is a platform to store your website files and collaborate with others. It is the social media of developers.

## Making your website live

We will be using the Github Pages feature of Github to make your website live. And why do we intend to use it? Cause, it's free. Let's get started:

- Create a new account at [Github](https://github.com/join).
- Next [create a repository](https://github.com/new) for your website.
- In the repository name, write the name for your website. Since we have created a bird website, let's name your website on the name of your bird like `my-bird-name-website`. Next click on the button with the text **Create new repository**.

- Drag and drop your website folder into the repository and then click commit changes.
- Navigate to the `Settings` tab on Github. Click on the `Pages` link from the sidebar on the left. It will show a panel like this:

- Click on the dropdown under the **Source** heading. Select `main` branch from the list of the options. Click on **Save** button. The page will refresh.
- Next you will see an address like `https://your-website-name.github.io` on the page. If you navigate to the link, it will show your website.
