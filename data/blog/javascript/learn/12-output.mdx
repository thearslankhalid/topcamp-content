# Outputing the results of JS

### Console.log("some value", "by comma", "you can keep increasing", "also change color", "find out yourself");

### alert

The mini-window with the message is called a modal window
. The word “modal” means that the visitor can’t interact with the rest of the page, press other buttons, etc, until they have dealt with the window.

### prompt

A prompt is a modal window with a text message and input field for the visitor.

```JS

let name  = promp("What is your name","shah");
alert(`You are ${name}`);
[default]
```

### confirm

```JS
    let result = confirm("IS your name TopCamp?");
alert(result)
```
