# Javascript Classes

A JavaScript class is a blueprint for creating objects

Syntax

```JS
class ClassName {
  constructor() { ... }
}
```

Example

```JS
class Person {
  constructor(name, data_of_birth) {
    this.name = name;
    this.data_of_birth = death_of_birth;
  }
}
```

The following example creates a class named "Person"

Note:

- A JavaScript class is not an object.

- It is a template for JavaScript objects.

### Using Classes

When you have a class, you can use it to create object:

for example

```JS
let first_person = new Person("Ahmad", "24-8-1876")
let second_persoon = new Person("Qazi", "5-8-1990");
```

## What is constructor?

constructor is a method.

It is executed whenever a new object is created.

It is used to initialize the object properties.

If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method

## class methods

declated after the constructor method

Example

```JS

class Person {
    constructor(name, data_of_birth) {
    this.name = name;
    this.data_of_birth = data_of_birth;
  }

    firstFunction(){
        //would make a statment and return it
			return "function call"

    }

    secondFunction(){

    }
}


let first_person = new Person("Ahmad", "24-8-1875");

console.log("this is man", first_person.firstFunction());


```
