# Callback

A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function

This allows a function to call another function

> > In Javascript functions are executed in the same sequence they are called not in the sequence they are declared.

### Example function sequence

Example 1 (calling functions separately)

```JS

function showResults(result){
	console.log("this is result", result)
}

function calculator(a, b){
	return a * b
}



let result = calculator(5,4)

showResults(result)
```

Problem with this is we have to make seperate function calls

Example 2 (one function calls another)

```JS

function showResults(result){
	console.log("this is result", result)
}

function calculator(a, b){
	showResults( a * b)

}
 calculator(5,4)

```

Problem with this is that we now everytime display function is called.

NOW here comes callback

Callback Example

```JS

function showResults(result){
	console.log("this is result", result)
}

function calculator(a, b, callback){
	callback( a * b)

}



 calculator(5,4, showResults)

```

Where callbacks really shine are in asynchronous functions, where one function has to wait for another function (like waiting for a file to load).
