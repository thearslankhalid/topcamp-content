# What is a function

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task, taking some form of input and returning an output.

To define a function, you must use the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ( ). Then you have to write the function logic between curly brackets { }

```JS

function greet(name){

    //body

    console.log("Hello" + name);
}

greet('John');
greet('Mary');

```

### return in a function

```JS

    function addNumbers(x,y){

        return x+y
    }

   let add = addNumbers(2,5);

   console.log("Added numbers", add);

```

### language own functions

Square function like square(2)

## Why use functions?

Functions are great for efficiency - you can define it one time and then use it multiple times, as needed. You don't have to rewrite the same or similar code over and over again.
