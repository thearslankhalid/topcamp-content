# Promises

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. We use promises when we need a specific function or piece of code to
complete its execution and then execute rest of the code after it.

Previously callbacks were used for this purpose but it created a lot of unmanageable code and reduced code readability.

Syntax

```JS

let my_first_promise = new Promise(function(Resolve, Reject) {
    //runs when successful execution
    Resolve();
    //runs when failed execution
    Reject();
});

//executes after the promise has been fulfilled
myPromise.then(
//success code run
  function(value),
  //error in execution of the code
  function(error)
);

```

### Promise Object

A promise object can be pending (which means working and it is undefined)

Fulfilled meaning the promise is fulfilled or complete and result is some value

Rejected means there was an error and error object is the result.

Example

we will use example by using a callback function called timeout

using callback

```JS

setTimeout(function() { myFunction("This is a callback function"); }, 3000);

function myFunction(value) {
  console.log( value);
	}


```

using promise

```JS


let my_first_promise = new Promise(function(Resolve, Reject) {
  setTimeout(function() { Resolve("This is from promise!!"); }, 3000);
});

my_first_promise.then(function(value) {
  console.log( value);
});


```
