# What is programming and javascript

## Programming

In simple words "Programming" is a way to instruct the computer to perform a task or tasks.

Now what does _instruct the computer_ mean?

Instruct a computer means that you provide the computer a set of instructions the are written in a language that a computer understands.

Examples of task or tasks are calculating a sum of 2 or more numbers or calculating interests or anything.

## JavaScript as Programming Language

Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

It is mainly the language of Web.

Javascript is one of the 3 languages that is necessary to learn Web Development.

First two were HTML and CSS which you learnt in previous classes.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

Our environment of work would be browser for now.

Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

- V8 - in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
- SpiderMonkey - in Firefox.

The terms above are good to remember because they are used in developer articles on the internet. We’ll use them too. For instance, if “a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably works in Chrome, Opera and Edge

## Setting up our envriornment

```HTML

<!DOCTYPE HTML>

<html>

<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>

</html>

```

Javascript could would always be inserted in `<script>` tag or it could be imported from other file.

The `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.

IF you want to execute an external script than it could be imported as follows

```HTML
<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>

```

To attach a script with URL e.g a library

```HTML
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>

```

Or if you want to import many files

```HTML
<script src="/js/script1.js"></script>
<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>
```

### Comments in JavaScript

With time programs i.e our code becomes more and more complex. So sometimes it becomes necessary to add comments to describe what the code does and why

We can add comments in any place in our script and they don't effect the execution of the code. Comments are just ignored when the code
is being complied.

one line comment can be added by //

```JS
// alert("this is comments")
```

multi line comment can be added using /\* \*/

```JS
    /*alert("multi")
    alert("Line")
    alert("Comment")*/
```

It is a good practice to add comments in your code so others could understand it. And having too many comments isn't any issues, since there are tools that minify the code before deploying and the comments are removed from it. Hence, comments have no negative effect on production at all.
