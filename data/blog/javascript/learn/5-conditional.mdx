# Conditionals

Conditionals control behavior in code or in this case in our JavaScript code, and it determines whether or not pieces of code can run.

In simple terms its like a terms and condition document of an organization. You can take it as a rule, if that rule is followed then you can work otherwise you have to leave.

## There are two sets of conditionals for now If..else of switch

## If..else

It has following keywords

- if
- else
- else if

> > if statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.

> > else if statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.

> > else statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code.

The if and else if statement would only run if the condition inside the parentheses is true

```JS

if(true){
    statment 1
}

else if(true){
    statment 2
}

else {
    statment3
}

```

Example

```JS

if(true){
	console.log("this is if")
}
else if(true){
	console.log("this is else if")
}

else{
	console.log("this is else ")
}

```

## switch

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Syntax

```JS
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}

```

If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

Example??

### break keyword

When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution inside the switch block.

Note: If you omit the break statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does not match the case.

### default

The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match:

> The default case does not have to be the last case in a switch block:

### Common code block

Sometimes you will want different switch cases to use the same code.

```JS

switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 4:
  case 5:
    console.log("Soon it is Weekend");
    break;
  case 0:
  case 6:
    console.log("It is Weekend");
    break;
  default:
      console.log("Looking forward to the Weekend");

}
```

### switching details

If multiple cases matches a case value, the first case is selected.

If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the default label.

If no default label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) after the switch.

# Comparisons

Comparisons and logical operators are used to test for true or false.

- \== equal to
- \=== equal value and equal type
- \!= not equal
- \!== not equal value or not equal type
- \> greater than
- \< less than
- \>= greater than or equal to
- \<\= less than or equal to

Example

```JS

let i = 10;

console.log("==", i==10)
console.log("==", i==6)
console.log("==", i=="10")

console.log("===", i===10)
console.log("===", i===6)
console.log("===", i==="10")

 console.log("!= ", i!= 10)
console.log("!= ", i!= 6)
console.log("!= ", i!= "10")

 console.log("!== ", i!== 10)
console.log("!== ", i!== 6)
console.log("!== ", i!== "10")

 console.log("> ", i> 10)
console.log("> ", i> 6)
console.log(">", i> "10")

 console.log("<  ", i<  10)
console.log("<  ", i<  6)
console.log("< ", i< "10")

 console.log(">= ", i>= 10)
console.log(">= ", i>= 6)
console.log(">= ", i>= "10")

 console.log("<=  ", i<= 10)
console.log("<=  ", i<= 6)
console.log("<= ", i<=  "10")


```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

- \&& and Both have to be true`
- \|| or only one statment has to be true
- \! not if false it gives true
