# Conditionals

Conditionals control behavior in code or in this case in our JavaScript code, and it determines whether or not pieces of code can run.

In simple terms its like a terms and condition document of an organization. You can take it as a rule, if that rule is followed then you can work otherwise you have to leave.

## There are two sets of conditionals for now If..else or switch

## If..else

It has following keywords

- if
- else
- else if

> > if statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.

> > else if statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.

> > else statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code.

The if and else if statement would only run if the condition inside the parentheses is true

```JS

if(true){
    statment 1
}

else if(true){
    statment 2
}

else {
    statment3
}

```

Example

```JS

if(true){
	console.log("this is if")
}
else if(true){
	console.log("this is else if")
}

else{
	console.log("this is else ")
}

```

the if statement evaluates a condition in the parenthesis and if the results are true it would execute that block of code.

### Boolean conversion

The if statement evaluates the expression in its parenthesis and converts the result in boolean.

so a number 0, an empty string “”, null, undefined, NaN and false all become false.

others become true

The `if` statement may contain an optional `else` block. It executes when the condition is false.

```JS
if(year == 2022){
	console.log("This is our year")
}else{
console.log("this is not our year")
}

```

Conditional Operators '?'

Sometimes, we need to assign a variable depending on a condition.

WE use ? operator

It lets us perform the action in shorter and simpler way.

It is also called ternary operator.

```JS
let value = condition ? value_one : value_two

```

The condition is evaluated: if it's truth then value_one is returned, otherwise - value_two.

```JS
let access_allowed = age > 18 ? "Yes" : "False"

```

A sequence of '?' operator could be added to the statement.

```JS

let age = 101

let message = age < 10 ? "Hey! child" : age < 18 ? "Hello Teenager" : age > 100 ? "Hello Old man" : "What an unsual age";
console.log(message)

```

## switch

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

Syntax

```JS
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}

```

If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

Example??

### break keyword

When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution inside the switch block.

Note: If you omit the break statement, the next case will be executed even if the evaluation does not match the case.

### default

The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match:

> The default case does not have to be the last case in a switch block:

### Common code block

Sometimes you will want different switch cases to use the same code.

```JS

switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 4:
  case 5:
    console.log("Soon it is Weekend");
    break;
  case 0:
  case 6:
    console.log("It is Weekend");
    break;
  default:
      console.log("Looking forward to the Weekend");

}
```

### switching details

If multiple cases matches a case value, the first case is selected.

If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the default label.

If no default label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) after the switch.

# Comparisons

Comparisons and logical operators are used to test for true or false.

- \== equal to
- \=== equal value and equal type
- \!= not equal
- \!== not equal value or not equal type
- \> greater than
- \< less than
- \>= greater than or equal to
- \<\= less than or equal to

Example

```JS

let i = 10;

console.log("==", i==10)
console.log("==", i==6)
console.log("==", i=="10")

console.log("===", i===10)
console.log("===", i===6)
console.log("===", i==="10")

 console.log("!= ", i!= 10)
console.log("!= ", i!= 6)
console.log("!= ", i!= "10")

 console.log("!== ", i!== 10)
console.log("!== ", i!== 6)
console.log("!== ", i!== "10")

 console.log("> ", i> 10)
console.log("> ", i> 6)
console.log(">", i> "10")

 console.log("<  ", i<  10)
console.log("<  ", i<  6)
console.log("< ", i< "10")

 console.log(">= ", i>= 10)
console.log(">= ", i>= 6)
console.log(">= ", i>= "10")

 console.log("<=  ", i<= 10)
console.log("<=  ", i<= 6)
console.log("<= ", i<=  "10")


```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

- \&& and Both have to be true`
- \|| or only one statment has to be true
- \! not if false it gives true

# Logical Operators

There are 4 logical operators in JS

|| OR

&& AND

! NOT

?? Nullish Coalescing

or Logical possiblities

```JS
console.log( true || true );   // true
console.log( false || true );  // true
console.log( true || false );  // true
console.log( false || false ); // false

```

As we can see, the result is always `true` except for the case when both operands are `false`.

If an operand is not a boolean, it’s converted to a boolean for the evaluation.

```JS
if (1 || 0) { // works just like if( true || false )
  console.log( 'truthy!' );
}

```

example in if

```JS
let time = 2;
if(time < 2 || time > 2){
		console.log("this is 2 time")
}

```

The AND operator is represented with two ampersands &&:

```JS
result = a && b;

```

In classical programming, AND returns true if both operands are truthy and false otherwise:

```JS
  console.log( true && true );   // true
console.log( false && true );  // false
console.log( true && false );  // false
console.log( false && false ); // false
```

```JS
let hour = 12;
let minute = 30;

if (hour == 12 && minute == 30) {
  console.log( 'The time is 12:30' );
}
```

The precedence of AND && operator is higher than OR ||.

### NOT

The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign !.

```JS

result = !value;
```

The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:

1. Converts the operand to boolean type: `true/false`.
2. Returns the inverse value.

\***\*Nullish coalescing operator '??'\*\***

The nullish coalescing operator is written as two question marks `??`.

As it treats `null`
 and `undefined`
 similarly, we’ll use a special term here, in this article. For brevity, we’ll say that a value is “defined” when it’s neither `null`
 nor `undefined`
.

The result of `a ?? b` is:

- if `a` is defined, then `a`,
- if `a` isn’t defined, then `b`

In other words, `??` returns the first argument if it’s not `null/undefined`. Otherwise, the second one.

```JS
  In other words, ?? returns the first argument if it’s not null/undefined. Otherwise, the second one.


```

Now it should be absolutely clear what `??` does. Let’s see where it helps.

The common use case for `??` is to provide a default value.

```JS
  let user;

console.log(user ?? "Anonymous"); // Anonymous (user not defined)
```

- `||` returns the first *truthy* value.
- `?? returns the first *defined* value.

In other words, `||`
doesn’t distinguish between `false`
, `0`
, an empty string `""`
and `null/undefined`
. They are all the same – falsy values. If any of these is the first argument of `||`
, then we’ll get the second argument as the result.

Due to safety reasons, JavaScript forbids using `??`
together with `&&`
and `||`
operators, unless the precedence is explicitly specified with parentheses.
