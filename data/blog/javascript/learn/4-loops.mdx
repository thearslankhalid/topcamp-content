# Loops

Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly without writing any extra code. It runs the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

A single execution of the loop body is called iteration.

```JS

for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}

```

There are many different kinds of loops but all of them perform the same function which is that they repeat the same action for a number of times.

### Loops types

- for loop
- do while
- while
- for in (study later with objects)

> > important statments in loops continue and break

### for loop

A for loop repeats itself until a specified condition is false.

```JS
for ( initialExpression; conditionExpression; incrementExpression)
  statement
```

Examples

```JS
let expenditure = [1,2,5,6,7,8,9];
let total = 0;
  for(let i = 0 ; i < expenditure.length; i++){
    total = total + expenditure[i];
  }

  console.log("total", total);

```

```JS
  1st step  (begin)        let i = 0             Executes once upon entering the loop.
  2nd step  (condition)    i<expenditure.length  Checked before every loop iteration. If false, the loop stops.
  3rd step  (body)         total = total + expenditure[i]; Runs again and again while the condition is truthy.
  4th step   (i++)         Executes after the body on each iteration.

```

### do while

A do while statements repeats itself until a specified condition evaluates to false

```JS
do
  statement
while (condition);
```

If condition is true, the statement executes again. At the end of every execution, the condition is checked. When the condition is false, execution stops, and control passes to the statement following do...while.

This form of syntax should only be used when you want the body of the loop to execute at least once regardless of the condition being truthy.

```JS
let j = 0;
do {
 j += 1;
  console.log(j);
} while (j < 7);
```

### while

A while statement executes the same statement again and again until the condition evaluates to false.

```JS

while(condition){
    statement
}

```

```JS
while(true){
console.log("Hello world")
}

```

### for in

The for in statment iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object.

Syntax

```JS
for (variable in object)
  statement
```

### break and continue

- The break statment "Jumps out" of a loop
- The continue statment "Jumps over" one iteration in the loop.

# Practice Problems

Problem 1 : Print numbers from 1 to 10
Problem 2 : Print the multiplication table with 7
Problem 3 : Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10
Problem 4 : Calculate the sum of numbers in an array of numbers
var ar = [2, 3, -1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 15, 95];
Problem 5 : Calculate the average of the numbers in an array of numbers
