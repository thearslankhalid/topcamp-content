# Data Types

An application that's built in JavaScript needs to work with information (although all languages work with information).

For example:
A social media website e.g Facebook
or an online shopping website e.g Daraz

To store the information we use variables.

Variables hold data/save data.

They are the containers that hold data in them.

A variable has a type, value and a location.

JavaScript variables can hold different data types: numbers, strings, objects etc

```javascript
var name = 'Top'
console.log('name', name)
```

var is the keyword that tells JavaScript that we are declaring a variable.

Similar to var we have const and let.

Also a variable is somethings whose value can be changed in future.

### A real life analogy could be a box (variable), box contents (its memory)

### var

The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function.
This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.

```JS
    var greeter = "hey hi";

    function newFunction() {
        var hello = "hello";
    }
```

Here, greeter is globally scoped because it exists outside a function while hello is function scoped. So we cannot access the variable hello outside of a function. So if we do this:

```JS
   var tester = "hey hi";

    function newFunction() {
        var hello = "hello";
    }
    console.log(hello); // error: hello is not defined
```

var variables can be re-declared and updated

### let

let is now preferred for variable declaration.

let is block scoped

But then what is a block?

A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. Anything within curly braces is a block.

```JS
   let greeting = "Bye!!";
   let times = 4;

   if (times > 3) {
        let hello = "Yo! Hey";
        console.log(hello);// "Yo! Hey"
    }
   console.log(hello) // hello is not defined
```

We see that using hello outside its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. This is because let variables are block scoped;

let can be updated but not re-declared.

### Const

Variables declared with the const maintain constant values.

They cannot be reassigned.

const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.

const declarations are block scoped

const cannot be updated or re-declared

BEST PRACTICE FOR DECLARING CONSTANTS

use UPPERCASE CONSTANTS

```JS
const interest_rate = 0.4;
//see invalid error being shown because const cannot be modified
interest_rate = 1;
console.log("interest rate", interest_rate);
```

## Rules for naming variables

- Cant be reserved keywords e.g static, const, if etc
- Use some case like camel, snake case to have a coherent understanding and simplicity
- Should be meaningfull
- Cannot start with the number
- Cannot contain space or hyphen
- Case sensitive
- Declare multiple variables but not necessary

You should name the variables right.

A variable name should have a clean, obvious meaning, describing the data that it stores

So give sufficent time to think about the variables and give them right name so it is easier to understand that that variable
holdes when you look back at your code after some time or someone else sees it.

## Primitive type and Reference type

### primitive types

string
number
boolean
undefiend
null

They are not objects, and do not have methods.
Note: Javascript is a dynamic language it detects the type itself but in C++ you have to declate int or string.

JavaSvript converts primitive strings to string objects, so that it is possible to use string object methods.

There are eight basic data types in Javascript. We can put any type of data in a variable. e.g at one time it can be a
number stored in it and the next time we can overwrite the value of that variable with some string

```JS
let greeting = 123456;
gretting = "Hi!"

```

Programming languages what allow such type of flexiblity are called dynamically types language meaning that there exist data type but variables are not bound by them.

### Number

The number data type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

NaN means not a number

```JS
    console.log("this is not a number" / 2);
```

BigInt

In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values larger than `(253-1)`
 (that’s `9007199254740991`
), or less than `-(253-1)`
 for negatives. It’s a technical limitation caused by their internal representation.

For most purposes integer data type in enough, but sometimes we need really big numbers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps.

A `BigInt` value is created by appending `n` to the end of an integer:

e.g

`const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;`

but bigInt numbers are rarely used in normal SaaS based applications.

### string

we can declare string by

```JS
    let str = "This is string 1";
let str2 = 'This is string 2';
let str3 = `we can do this when we need to add a number or add some other value ${str}`;
```

Back ticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in `${…}`

### Boolean

### null

It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

### undefined

The meaning of `undefined` is “value is not assigned”.

Functions belong to the object type. But typeof treats them differently, returning "function"

### How to know what type of variable it is? Use typeof

There is no float type in JavaScript

### Reference types

Reference data types, unlike primitive data types, are dynamic in nature. That is, they do not have a fixed size.
Most of them are considered as objects, and therefore have methods.

object
Array
Function (Study in Next lecture)

### Object

An object has a set of properties and functions

```JS

let student =
    name: "Maaz",
    age: 20,


console.log("Student", student);

```

How to change object values

1. By dot notaation

```JS
   student.name = "Ahmad"

```

2. By bracket notation

```JS
    student["name"] = "Ahmad"

```

Re Declaration of Reference and Primitive Types

```JS
let a = "Orange"
let b = a
b = "Mango"


console.log("For variable scope",a, b)

 let object_a = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Ahmad"
}

let object_b = object_a;

object_b.name = "Maaz"

console.log(object_a)
console.log(object_b)
```

## ARRAYS

In JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable

Two Methods of Declare an Array

```JS
var House = [ ]; // method 1
var House = new Array(); // method 2
```

```JS
var selected_color = ['red', 'blue']
console.log("selected", selected_color)
//length, add in array by index //dynamic array numner and string combination
```

Arrays have functions like
push
pop
unshift
concat

Are Array reference types? if Yes show show with an example
