# Data Types


Variables hold data/save data. They are the containers that hold data in them. 
A variable has a type, value and a location.

JavaScript variables can hold different data types: numbers, strings, objects etc

```JS
var name = 'Top';
console.log("name",name);
```

var is the keyword that tells JavaScript that we are declaring a variable.

Similar to var we have const and let.

Also a variable is somethings whose value can be changed in future. 

### var

The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function.
This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.


```JS
    var greeter = "hey hi";

    function newFunction() {
        var hello = "hello";
    }
```

Here, greeter is globally scoped because it exists outside a function while hello is function scoped. So we cannot access the variable hello outside of a function. So if we do this:

```JS
   var tester = "hey hi";

    function newFunction() {
        var hello = "hello";
    }
    console.log(hello); // error: hello is not defined
```

var variables can be re-declared and updated

### let

let is now preferred for variable declaration.

let is block scoped

But then what is a block?

A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. Anything within curly braces is a block.

```JS
   let greeting = "Bye!!";
   let times = 4;

   if (times > 3) {
        let hello = "Yo! Hey";
        console.log(hello);// "Yo! Hey"
    }
   console.log(hello) // hello is not defined
```

We see that using hello outside its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. This is because let variables are block scoped;

let can be updated but not re-declared.

### Const

Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.

const declarations are block scoped
const cannot be updated or re-declared

```JS
const interest_rate = 0.4;
//see invalid error being shown because const cannot be modified
interest_rate = 1;
console.log("interest rate", interest_rate);
```

## Rules for naming variables

- Cant be reserved keywords e.g static, const, if etc
- Use some case like camel, snake case to have a coherent understanding and simplicity
- Should be meaningfull
- Cannot start with the number
- Cannot contain space or hyphen
- Case sensitive
- Declare multiple variables but not necessary

## Primitive type and Reference type

### primitive types

string
number
boolean
undefiend
null

They are not objects, and do not have methods.
Note: Javascript is a dynamic language it detects the type itself but in C++ you have to declate int or string.

JavaSvript converts primitive strings to string objects, so that it is possible to use string object methods.

### How to know what type of variable it is? Use typeof

There is no float type in JavaScript

### Reference types

Reference data types, unlike primitive data types, are dynamic in nature. That is, they do not have a fixed size.
Most of them are considered as objects, and therefore have methods.

object
Array
Function (Study in Next lecture)

### Object

An object has a set of properties and functions

```JS

let student =
    name: "Maaz",
    age: 20,


console.log("Student", student);

```

How to change object values

1. By dot notaation

```JS
   student.name = "Ahmad"

```

2. By bracket notation

```JS
    student["name"] = "Ahmad"

```

Re Declaration of Reference and Primitive Types

```JS
let a = "Orange"
let b = a
b = "Mango"


console.log("For variable scope",a, b)

 let object_a = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Ahmad"
}

let object_b = object_a;

object_b.name = "Maaz"

console.log(object_a)
console.log(object_b)
```

## ARRAYS

In JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable

Two Methods of Declare an Array

```JS
var House = [ ]; // method 1
var House = new Array(); // method 2
```

```JS
var selected_color = ['red', 'blue']
console.log("selected", selected_color)
//length, add in array by index //dynamic array numner and string combination
```

Arrays have functions like
push
pop
unshift
concat

Are Array reference types? if Yes show show with an example
